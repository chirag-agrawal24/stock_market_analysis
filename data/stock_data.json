The company says its new Lomo\u2019Instant Wide Glass is the \u201csharpest instant camera on earth,\u201d but while it probably outperforms other Lomography offerings, it\u2019s up against instant alternatives like the Nons SL660 which is compatible with EF mount lenses. And in either case, it\u2019s still going to be held back by the limitations of instant film.\n\nThose upgraded optics come with a much steeper price tag. The Lomo\u2019Instant Wide Glass is available now for $279, where as the all-plastic Lomo\u2019Instant Wide Camera Black Edition is still $169. Fujifilm\u2019s own Instax Wide 400 is even cheaper at $149.95, while Fujifilm\u2019s Instax Wide film stock, which is what this new camera uses, is $18.99 for 20 exposures.\n\nThe Lomo\u2019Instant Wide Glass includes a lens cap that doubles as a wireless shutter remote.
